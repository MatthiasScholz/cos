## Documentation

### Where to put what

Document as near as possible to the part you are going to add additional information.
Good structuring and meaningful variable and function names might reduce the need
of creating additional text.

Documentation which is related to the source code should be done
either directly in the file or using Markdown.

Furthermore to describe concepts and evaluation results the GitHub Wiki
pages should be used.

### Markdown

Markdown files have to checked against the "Style Checker".

#### Style Checker

Use Markdown style formatter: [Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint).
